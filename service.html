		  <h2 id="door">Door to Door minibus service starts in Tennant Creek</h2>
            <p>Tennant Creek Transport has announced the commencement of a door-to-door bus service to start on the 20th of March.</p>
            <p>"Ever since we started the town service there have been some people who would prefer a service that takes them directly to their destination." said service Convenor Georgina Bracken, "Well this is the service for them".</p>
            <p>Service planner David Denmark explained that the service would also be a boon to many people with disabilities who also have difficulty getting to the town service bus stops. "The bus we use is wheelchair accessible and can pick people up at their homes and take them right to the door of their destination", he explained.</p>
            <p>NDIS participants can also use the service and have the cost billed against their NDIS budget.  The service also offers a 50% discount for people who are registered members of the Taxi Subsidy Scheme.The service will run initially from 9 am to 3 pm (earlier for those catching the morning flight to Alice Springs) Monday to Friday.  To make a booking call 0467 335 400.</p> 
		  <h3 id="dam">Dam good service on Australia Day</h3> 
		    <p>Tennant Creek Transport and Barkly Regional Council combined on Australia Day to put on a shuttlebus service to festivities out at Mary Ann Dam. Both agencies contributed to the cost of the service with volunteer bus assistants  provided by the transport group.</p>
	        <p>The service ran from 11.30 in the morning until the last service home at 6 p.m. Drivers Jerry Kelly and Adam Vibau picked up people at community living areas and points along the main street.</p>       
            <p>TCT Convenor, Georgina Bracken told us that the service was a success with nearly 120 passengers. "It was great to see that almost half of the passengers were children who were treated to a great day out" she said.</p>
			<h2 id="creek">Tennant Creek Charter Service growing</h2>
			<p>Tennant Creek Transport's charter service is growing, providing businesses and agencies in the region with another affordable transport option.</P>
			<p>"This is a great service for groups that do not have their own transport", said Business Manager David Denmark. It is also well worth agencies who do own minibuses to consider our service as an alternative to the expensive business of purchasing and owning vehicles and having staff wasting their valuable time on driving duties." He continued.</p>

			<h2>New Bus for Tennant Creek Transport</h2>
			<p>Due to the generosity of the Government's Remote Australia Strategy Program, Tennant Creek residents will soon be travelling around town in a brand new bus.The bus, a Golden Dragon, has a much greater passenger capacity than TCT's other buses with 24 seats and will provide more space for passengers and baggage (mainly shopping) on the Town Service. It is also equipped with a wheelchair hoist to enable access for people with disability.</p>
			<p>The vehicle has a multicultural feel about it having an American engine, British gearbox, seats made in Australia and was manufactured in China by one of the biggest bus builders in the world.TCT bought the bus in Melbourne from Patico Automotive and it was delivered to Tennant Creek by volunteer driver Andrew Clark. The journey took in stormy weather in Melbourne and South Australia and the summer heat of the red center.</p>
			<h2>Barkly Youth Services makes bus available to Tennant Creek Transport</h2>
			<p>In a generous gesture of goodwill the Barkly Youth Service has agreed that Tennant Creek Transport can use their minibus on the Town Service for the next six months.The bus has been re-registered with the Motor Vehicle Registry so it can operate the important public transport service.</p>
			<p>"This is a great example of non-profit agencies working together to improve the lives of Tennant Creek residents" said Tennant Creek Transport Convenor Georgina Bracken."The bus was not being used at the Youth service as it is between funding grants so we are able to take our oldest bus off the road for a well earned rest and some maintenance" Ms Bracken explained.</p>
			<h2>Early morning service suspended until further notice</h2>
			<p>We are sorry to have to announce that the early morning bus service which has been operating between 6 a.m and 9 a.m. has been suspended.This service, which was funded by a charitable foundation, was not patronised quite enough to keep it going.  Transport Planner David Denmark explained that "Given that Tennant Creek Transport has just started an exciting new door-to-door minibus service which will require all of our resources to make a success, the loss-making early morning service will have to close until we can find a body to provide an ongoing subsidy".</p>
			<h2>New Door-to-Door Minibus service starts on Monday 18th in Tennant Creek</h2>
			<p>Tennant Creek Transport has just announced that a new Minibus Service is to commence on Monday the 18th of April in Tennant Creek. The minibus will operate a bit like a taxi with passengers being able to ring up and book a trip."This is the result of many months of hard work by the Tennant Creek Transport Committee" explained transport planner David Denmark.</p>
			<p>"Since the taxi left town there has been no demand responsive service in the town. While the town bus does a very good job it runs on a fixed route and this does not suit everybody" he continued.The service will enable people to obtain transport to and from the airport and to other places not on the current bus route.</p>
