            <p >Having achieved incorporation we will be recruiting new members and seeking seed funding. You can join in on this exciting journey by clicking on the "Apply for membership"  button to the left of the page. It's free!  If you have any bright ideas about finding seed funding click on the "Leave a comment" button and send us a message.</p>
			<h2 id="purp">The purpose of the group</h2>
			<ol>
			<li>Address transport disadvantage in the Barkly region in whatever form it takes through the promotion of passenger transport services.</li>
			<li>Assist people, who have no ready access to private transport, to access services and take part in activities of their choice.</li>
			<li>Encourage healthy, active transport options such as walking or cycling.</li>
			<li>Facilitate the development of suitable transport infrastructure such as transit centres or bus stops.</li>
			</ol>	
          <p>The group will also work on the establishment of a vehicle register and driver pool and on providing information about transport options to community members.</p>
          <h2 id="where">Where we came from</h2>          
	        <p>The group was set up as a result of a community transport planning project run by David Denmark from Transport Planning and Management, organised by NTCOSS and funded by local agencies, the NT Government, NTCOSS and the Sidney Myer Foundation.  The project involved extensive interviews with staff from local agencies and two workshops.</p>
          
		  <p>At a meeting held on the 16th of August 2012 a group of local residents formed a transport group for Tennant Creek called Tennant Creek Transport Inc. The group has since become an Incorporated Association under the Northern Territory Associations Act. We have Deductible Gift Recipient Status with the Tax Office and are a Public Benevolent Institution.</p>

		  <h2 id="object">A new transport group for Tennant Creek</h2>
            <p>At a meeting held on the 16th of August a group of local residents formed a transport group for Tennant Creek to be called Tennant Creek Transport Incorporated. The purpose of the group is to improve transport and mobility options for residents of the town and the Barkly region.</p>			
            <p>The group has lodged an application to become an Incorporated Association under the Northern Territory Associations Act.</p>  
		    <p>Peopleâ€™s ability to move around affects how and when they are able to access goods, services, social and recreational pursuits, training, employment and their ability to partake and contribute as members of a community. Those people who have no ready access to private transport or who cannot access public transport for whatever reason are considered to be transport disadvantaged.</P>
